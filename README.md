## About Program	
This program is a Blackjack game played within java with an opponent (created using if/else statements) and the player being prompted on their choices throughout the game.\
The player is given 25k "chips" as starter money on each new session and the "chips" are used as a way to scorekeep as a little fun extra challenge for the player.
